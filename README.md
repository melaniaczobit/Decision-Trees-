# Loan-Approval
Goal: To examine credit card creditability and determine loan approval outcome 
The project aimed to analyze various attributes to build a classification model using two different methods: **Decision Tree** and **Naïve Bayes**.

Loan approval has a multitude of criterion that must be met. A German bank required a set of data describing credit risk to be analyzed on 20 attributes to determine credit card creditability for loan approval. Feature selection was crucial to both the bank and the customers to ensure a quick, accurate and safe decision that benefits both parties. To produce a fair classification tool, it was essential to use subject-matter expertise in determining which attributes will generate the best performing algorithm. It was imperative to omit any bias, including gender, racial and age bias, among others. Individuals who submit the same application information will receive the same decision for loan approval. The decision tree generated has a depth of 3 to classify 16 attributes. The high precision of 0.88 minimizes false positive approvals while remaining highly accurate at 0.78. The Naïve Bayes model maximizes the F1-score to 0.64. It is our recommendation that the decision tree be used for the purpose of loan approval.
